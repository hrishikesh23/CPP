Defination of Function Overloading:
Function Overloading is a logical method for calling several functions with different arguments and data types for performing similar activities or operations on expressions.

Rules 1:
Function overloading shall not be performed on arguments of same data type like

void foo(int i)
void foo(&int i)

Compiler resolves this as same data type.

Rule 2:

In Funcion overloading the argument passed to the function shall not be differentiated with pointer and base address.

void foo(array); // *
void foo(&array) // []

Rule 3:

Function overloading shall allow a data type as int and enum.

void foo(int i);
void foo(ENUM i);

Rule 4:

Function overloading shall have different data types.

void foo(int i);
void foo(float i);

Rule 5:

Function overloading shall have different number of arguments.

void foo(int i);
void foo(int j,float k);
